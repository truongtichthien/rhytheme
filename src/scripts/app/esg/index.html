    <p>In years past, employees only used the most advanced technology at work - it was just too expensive to buy for
      consumer use. Now, technology makes it into the hands of employees quickly and relatively inexpensively, and IT
      organizations are struggling to keep up. Employees are more technologically savvy than ever before, bringing new
      devices and applications into the enterprise whether IT supports them or not.</p>

    <h1>Striking the Balance between IT Control and User Freedom</h1>
    <p>Mobility in the enterprise has the potential to transform how we work, accelerating productivity by taking
      friction out of collaboration, communication, and workflows. Employees are better aware of how these devices and
      applications can be used to drive the biggest productivity gains. If IT doesn't respond to employee demand for
      these applications and devices, employees are very willing to go around IT and use them anyway.</p>
    <p>Given that employees are driving the demand for BYOD and enterprise file sync and share (EFSS) solutions, IT's
      biggest chance for success in keeping sensitive data out of rogue cloud services is to embrace employee input and
      make them a part of the policy and selection process. </p>
